### Definition

Given a positive number n. Let V be a set of 2n integers 1, 2, ..., 2n.

A starter balanced tournament design (SBTD) of order n, denoted as SBTD(n), is an n x (2n-1) array of all pairs of set V, such that

- Each cell of the array contains a pair of elements from V .
- Every pair of elements from V is contained in some cell.
- Each element of V is contained in each column.
- Each element is contained at most two times in each row.
- Each column is a starter.

Without loss of generality, we assume the first row of a SBTD(n) array is `[(1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (2n-2, 2n-1), (2n-1, 2n)]`.

### Directories structure

SBTD schedules are arranged in corresponding SBTD(n) instances and they are differentiated by their hash values.

```txt
SBTDn/
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue0>.txt
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue1>.txt
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue2>.txt
  ...
```
