This repository contains starter balanced tournament designs (SBTDs) generated by the ILP approach described in Nam-DÅ©ng Hoang, Quan Hoang, & Moshe Rosenfeld, _Starter Factorization of K_2n_.

# Directories structure

SBTD schedules are arranged in corresponding SBTD(n) instances and they are differentiated by their hash values.

```txt
SBTDn/
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue0>.txt
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue1>.txt
  SBTDn_schedule_<hashValue2>.txt
  ...
```
